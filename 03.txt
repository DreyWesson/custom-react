The useEffect implementation is still valuable even if state changes trigger re-renders. The useEffect hook is designed for handling side effectsâ€”operations that occur after the DOM has been updated, like fetching data, setting up subscriptions, or manually manipulating the DOM.

Why You Might Still Need useEffect:
Side Effects Management:

useEffect is not just about triggering re-renders; it's primarily used for handling effects that should happen after the DOM updates. For example, if you need to fetch data after a component mounts or update the document title when a component's state changes, useEffect is the right tool.
Conditional Execution:

useEffect can be set up to run only when certain dependencies change. This prevents unnecessary operations or API calls, enhancing performance and avoiding unintended behaviors.
Cleanup Functionality:

useEffect supports cleanup operations. For instance, if you set up a timer or a subscription, the cleanup function ensures that those resources are released when the component unmounts or before the effect runs again due to a dependency change.
